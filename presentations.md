    <h3 class="presentation-title">Sustaining conscious experience</h3>
    <p class="presentation-abstract">
      Traditional consciousness research relies on the contrastive method, aiming to isolate neural correlates of consciousness (NCCs) by comparing conscious and unconscious conditions. However, this approach faces major limitations, including confounds and ambiguity in interpreting both positive and negative findings. To overcome these issues, we focused on necessity dissociation: testing whether mechanisms proposed to be necessary for consciousness are absent even when experience is clearly present. In our first study (<a href="https://www.arc-cogitate.com/">ARC-cogitate</a>), we used intracranial EEG during sustained visual stimulation and found that posterior sensory regions tracked stimulus duration, while prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity was transient. This challenges theories like the global workspace theory (GNWT) that assign a central role to the PFC. Motivated by these results, our second study used the psychological refractory period (PRP) to track conscious access over time, revealing that conscious processing can decouple from stimulus dynamics. Together, these findings introduce a novel approach for testing theories of consciousness and highlight the complex relationship between sensory input and conscious experience.

    <h3 class="presentation-title">How Does the Brain Sustain Visual Experiences?</h3>
    <p class="presentation-abstract">
      While much research has focused on how (visual) stimuli enter awareness, less is known about how experiences persist and relate to sensory input. We addressed this questions in two studies using sustained visual stimuli. I first present evidence from intracranial EEG from the <a href="https://www.arc-cogitate.com/">ARC-cogitate</a> project, which reveal that while posterior sensory regions tracked stimulus duration, prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity was transient, challenging theories like the global workspace theory (GNWT) that assign a central role to the PFC in consciousness. Study 2, using the psychological refractory period (PRP) as a measure of conscious engagement, showed that conscious processing was independent of stimulus duration. Together, these findings suggest that conscious experience can decouple from sensory input even in simple conditions, with important implications for theories of consciousness.

    <p class="presentation-abstract">
          In this workshop, I presented the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-024-02508-y">framework</a> I have developped with Rony Hirschhorn, Katarina Bendtz, Liad Mudrik and Lucia Melloni to test experimental setups used to conduct event based visual experiments. After introducing the need for thorough and standardized testing of experimental setups to ensure that the expected experimental paradigm is fullfiled in practice, I offer a practical example based on a dummy experiment to illustrate how to conduct our  test battery in its entirety and how to report the results on protocols.io. By promoting transparency and reproducibility, this session equips researchers with essential skills to enhance research quality, faciliate replication and foster collaboration across the field.

    <h3 class="presentation-title">Temporal dynamics of visual conscious experience </h3>
    <p class="presentation-abstract">
        This talk explored the neural dynamics involved in sustaining conscious perception beyond stimulus entry. In the first study, we found that activation in the posterior cortex was linked to stimulus duration, while the prefrontal cortex (PFC) showed only brief activation at the onset. The second study used the psychological refractory period (PRP) to investigate the coupling between experience and stimulus presentation, showing delays in reaction times for both stimulus onset and offset, suggesting a link between conscious experience and presentation dynamics. Combined, our results challenge the role of PFC as an NCC candidate. However, the lack of a PRP effect on short trials suggests that temporal coupling may not be systematic. To fully leverage the temporal dimension of experience to isolate the NCC, further studies resolving the dynamics of experience on a single-trial basis are required.

    <h3 class="presentation-title">Bayesian tools to investigate the neural correlates of sustained visual presentation</h3>
    <p class="presentation-abstract">
        In this talk, I focused on presenting novel statistical analysis tools to compute global amount of evidence for a given theory that formulated several predictions across several recording modalities and experiment. By leveraging recent advancements in Bayesian inference, it is possible to approximate the log of evidence for a particular model (i.e. Marginal likelihood) as the free energy. This quantity can then simply be summed across predictions and recording modalities and compared against an alternative model (whose predictions concerned the same data) to arbitrate between the two across all the data being investigated.

    <h3 class="presentation-title">Unraveling the Dynamics of Sustained Visual Experience: Exploring Neural Activation with Varying Stimulus Durations | Tuesday Lunch Talk, Max Planck institute for empirical aesthetics, 2023</h3>
    <p class="presentation-abstract">
        I presented the results of studies in which we explored the neural mechanisms that sustain conscious perception, beyond the initial entry into awareness. Using visual stimuli of different durations, alongside invasive electrophysiology and behavioral reports from epilepsy patients, we tested predictions from Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNW). We found sustained activation in posterior regions but only transient activation in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting it may not be crucial for consciousness. Additional behavioral tests indicated that conscious while participants consciously experience the onset and offset of the visual stimulus, the depth of conscious processing of the offset was much shallower and potentially not present on every single trial.

    <h3 class="presentation-title">Refining our understanding of the neural mechanisms enabling consciousness by relying on theories predictive power</h3>
    <p class="presentation-abstract">
        In this talk, I present the result of my investigations regarding the neural mechanisms associated with conscious experience and highlight how we can rely on theories of consciousness to guide experiments and discoveries. For the most part, consciousness research has been conducted in a bottom up fashion, where experiments are being designed to isolate neural activity patterns that are systematically associated with consciousness. Based on the results of such experiments, theories of consciousness were formulated, proposing overarching mechanisms to be the source of consciousness. However, the field is currently fragmented, such that different theories are pursued in parallel, considering only part of the existing empirical evidence to be conclusive and discarding others based on methodological discords. In my research, I aim to help move the field forward by relying on a top down approach instead, whereby theories of consciousness formulate predictions a priori based on their current model. Failure to observe these predictions imply that the theories are at the very least incomplete and must be further refined.

       This poster focused on testing competing theories of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), through an adversarial collaboration within the COGITATE consortium. I present preliminary results of the iEEG recording modality, suggesting that while posterior electrodes activation correlates with stimulus duration, prefrontal activation does not. Supposing that participants did experience the persistence of the stimuli on the screen, these results challenge the role of the PFC as a neural correlate of conscious experience.

    <p class="presentation-abstract">
        This poster addresses the challenge of understanding how the brain produces subjective experience, critiquing theories of consciousness for focusing too narrowly on the entry of content into awareness. By investigating the temporal dynamics of conscious experience, we explore new ways to test these theories. The first study presents results from the COGITATE project, testing predictions from Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) regarding sustained visual presentation. The second study examines how events in a stream of images affect processing of subsequent stimuli, probing the temporal dynamics of consciousness.
