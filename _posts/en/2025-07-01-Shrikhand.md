Shrikhand is a delicious joghurt based dessert from India. It's very simple to make, it's just joghurt mixed with spices. It's great if you have guests and don't feel like making a complicated dessert (or if you aren't very good at making desserts). It will get your guests think you're a great cook, saying "oh wow, that's really delicious, would never have thought of that combination of flavour". So overall a very efficient dish.

# Ingredients (4 servings)
- 1.4 L joghurt (like greek joghurt or soy based joghurt to make it vegan)
- 2 pinches of Safron (optional, cause that stuff is expansive)
- 1 tbsp of Cardamom powder
- 100g sugar 
- 4 tbsp almonds
- 2 tbsp pistachios

# Steps
1. Chop the almonds and pistacchios into small chunks (size depends on how chunky you like it)
2. If you're using safron, let it soak in a tbsp of hot water or milk
3. Save some of the chopped nuts to the side for garnish, mix everything else together using a whisk until smooth
4. Place each portion in a ramequin or something like that, garnish with the nuts and serve
