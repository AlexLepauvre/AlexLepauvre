This isn't a recipe for a single dish, but rather the basics for sort of a sauce that will enable you to do many dishes. I eat some variation of this several times a week, and it never disappoints. The sauce has very 3 basic elements, to which you can add whatever your heart desires, and you can use it with any combinations of ingredients

# Ingredients

## The basics for the magic sauce (for 1 serving)
- 3 tbsp of Soy sauce (preferrably dark but whatever you like)
- 1 tbsp of vinegar (or lemon juice, anything quite sour will do the trick)
- 1 tsp of sugar (or honey, or agave, or anything sweet)

## Optional ingredients
- 2 cloves of garlic
- Ginger (as much as you like)
- chillies

# Steps
1. Mix everything together
2. Stir in with veggies, carbs and proteins on high heat 

Typically, I would stir fry whatever veggies I have on hands (paprika, beans, zucchinis, asparagus, steamed brokkoli...), some protein (tofu), cook some instant noodles or udon or leftover rice, then throw everything in the pan on high heat (as high as your stove gets) and stir everything together with the sauce, let it get together and the sauce reduce a bit, and it's ready to eat. If you're feeling fancy, you can top with some sesame seeds, finely chopped spring onions greens...

You can really mix and match with whatever you've got on hands. As long as you have soy sauce, vinegar and sugar in the sauce, it will be great. I you're not vegan, you can also scramble an egg, and if you eat meat you can add minced meat of your choice. You can also add any meat ersatz product. As long as you stir things really hot to get color on them, it will taste good. And don't hesitate to let it burn a little to get the nice charred taste.
