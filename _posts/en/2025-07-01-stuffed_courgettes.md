A great summer recipe, good to deal with the courgettes overload if you've planted them in your garden. It can be eaten on its own or with a side of salad. And I recommend to make a bit more than you think you will eat, courgette is not particularly filling, so you might eat more than you think.

# Ingredients
- Courgettes (the largest you can get)
- Onion (1 large)
- Garlic (2 cloves)
- Ricotta (250g)
- Parmesan (100g)
- Dried tomatoes (100g)
- Bread crumbs (200g, give or take, texture is what matter, see below)

# Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C
2. Slice the courgettes in half length wise, empty the seeds and mushy part with a spoon and chop it (the mushy part, not the courgette!)
3. Slice the onion and the sun dried tomatoes, peel the garlic
4. In a pan heated on medium add olive oil and once hot, toss the onions and the chopped inside of the courgette. Cook it for 5min until it starts to get slightly brown and the juices have evaporated
5. Add the garlic to the pan and toss for 2min 
6. Cut the heat and add the sundried tomatoes and the ricotta, stir to combine
7. Add the parmesan and the bread crumbs until the mixture is a bit dryer, but not completely crumbely
8. Add the whole perparation back inside the emptied courgette using a spoon and drizzle olive oil on top
9. Bake in the oven until the top is brown and the courgette is soft (test using a knife), that can take anywhere between 20min and 1h depending on the size of your courgette
