A ginger bug is a wild yeast and bacterial culture. It's basically the same thing as a sourdough, but to make drinks instead of bread. You can mix it with any sweet liquid (juice, water + sirup of your choice...) into food-grade, pressure safe bottles, and let it sit for a few days (burping every day to release pressure) and then you should have a nice (slightly alcoholic) sparkling drink!
