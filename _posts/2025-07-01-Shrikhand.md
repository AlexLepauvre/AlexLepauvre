Shrikhand is a delicious joghurt based dessert from India. It's very simple to make, it's just joghurt mixed with spices. It's great if you have guests and don't feel like making a complicated dessert (or if you aren't very good at making desserts). It will get your guests think you're a great cook, saying "oh wow, that's really delicious, would never have thought of that combination of flavour". So overall a very efficient dish.
