Kohlrabi is a bit of a difficult veggie. Some people love it raw, but it's a bit particular. And when cooked, it often tastes a bit off. This recipe is a great way to use kohlrabi in a way that its flavour is not too overpowering while still coming through a bit.

# Ingredients (4 servings)
- Kohlrabi
- Potatoes (about as much as the kohlrabi)
- Onion (1 large)
- Red curry paste (2 tbsp, or only 1 if you can't eat very spicy)
- Veggie broth (1L or so)
- Coconut milk (250-300mL)
- Butter (optional, skip to keep it vegan)

# Steps
1. Chop all your veggies (the kohlrabi and potatoes in chunks, the onions in slices)
2. Sweat the onions in a pot for a few minutes
3. Add in the potatoes and kohlrabi and cook together for a few minutes, until you start to see a bit of colour on the veggies
4. Add in the curry paste and stir together for 3 min
5. Add the broth and coconut milk to just cover the veggies
6. Cook until the kohlrabi and potatoes are soft
7. Mix everything using an immersion blender. Kohlrabi can be a bit fibrous, so mix it really well for quite some time. If you're mixer is not super powerful, you might want to pass your soup through a fine-mesh sieve, it takes a while but gives a nice smooth texture
8. Serve in bowls and garnish. I personally like pan fried vegan alternative to minced meat, or some tofu, as well as some chilly oil and finely sliced green onions, but anything you have would do (chives, parsley....)
